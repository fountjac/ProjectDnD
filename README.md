Analysis of DnD character creation data for STA 518 Project

## Dataset: [dnddata](https://github.com/oganm/dnddata) 
Dungeons and Dragons 5e offers many different options for character creation. This dataset contains information from thousands of different characters players have created. I’m interested in seeing the different ways people build their characters and what trends I might find.

This dataset was found on GitHub and some data manipulation and analysis already done, but I will take what has been done steps farther and dive deeper into the data to find useable insights. I plan on creating elaborate tables and graphical displays to gussy up my results.

## Goal
Analyze the dataset and create glorious tables to display my findings. There are many different avenues of character customization I can explore; what classes and subclasses are chosen, what spells do they pick, what is the most common fighting style, etc.
Discover what types of characters people are building and how many match the well known “most powerful builds” often seen made by min maxers.

I will explore the idea of randomly generating characters based off of this data as well. The purpose of that may be for DMs populating their worlds or it could be used for an interesting one shot.

## Why did I choose this topic?
Dungeons and dragons is a game beloved by many people, I am no exception. Everyone’s play group is different, but this type of analysis is helpful for knowing how to balance the game design. I’m also curious to see if people tend to gravitate towards stronger builds or are they more likely to design with more creativity?
